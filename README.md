# inspection-framework

The Data_Visualization notebook (`Data_Visualization.ipynb`) contains the analysis of ROS messages generated by the robot during inspections. It includes visualizations and summaries of relevant data extracted from the ROS messages.

The smart contracts for the Inspection Framework system are avaliable in the `smart-contracts` directory. The directory includes Solidity files for each contract.
