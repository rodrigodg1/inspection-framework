## Overview

This project provides a framework for industrial safety inspections. 

**For our most recent implementation of multi-robot inspection systems, please visit:**
[Multi-Robot Inspection Repository](https://github.com/MiguelHenri/Multi-Robot-Inspection)


The Data_Visualization notebook (`Data_Visualization.ipynb`) contains the analysis of ROS messages generated by the robot during inspections. It includes visualizations and summaries of relevant data extracted from the ROS messages.

The smart contracts for the Inspection Framework system are avaliable in the `smart-contracts` directory. The directory includes Solidity files for each contract.
