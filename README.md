## Overview

This project provides a framework for industrial safety inspections. 

**For our most recent implementation of multi-robot inspection systems, please visit:**
[Multi-Robot Inspection Repository](https://github.com/MiguelHenri/Multi-Robot-Inspection)


- All the smart contract logic is detailed in their respective [directory](https://github.com/rodrigodg1/inspection-framework/tree/main/smart-contracts).
- The smart contracts for the Inspection Framework system are available in the `smart-contracts` directory. The directory includes Solidity files for each contract.

The Data_Visualization notebook (`Data_Visualization.ipynb`) contains the analysis of ROS messages generated by the robot during inspections. It includes visualizations and summaries of relevant data extracted from the ROS messages.
