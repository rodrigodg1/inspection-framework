## Usage
This Solidity code defines a smart contract called ResultsContract that stores the results of inspections. 

The `constructor` function initializes the contract with a list of valid locations and sets the manager's address to the creator of the contract. 

The `InspectionResult` function creates an inspection result and adds it to the `results` array if the location is valid. 

The `UpdateValidLocations` function allows the manager to update the list of valid locations. 

The `GetValidLocations` function returns the list of valid locations.


## Struct
This code defines a struct called `Result` that represents the results of an inspection. A `Result` struct contains an inspector's address, the location of the inspection, and the result of the inspection.


## Functions
1. `Constructor(string[] memory _valid_locations)`: Initializes the contract with a list of valid locations and sets the manager's address to the creator of the contract.

2. `InspectionResult(string memory _InspectionPlace, string memory _result)`: Creates an inspection result and adds it to the `results` array if the location is valid.

3. `UpdateValidLocations(string[] memory newLocations)`: Allows the manager to update the list of valid locations.

4. `GetValidLocations()`: Returns the list of valid locations.
